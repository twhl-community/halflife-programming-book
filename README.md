# About

This repository hosts several code examples and tutorials for the [The Whole Half-Life's (TWHL) wiki](https://twhl.info/wiki). It's a fork of the [Half-Life: Updated](https://github.com/twhl-community/halflife-updated) repository.

If you want your sample/tutorial code to be added to this repository, please contact a TWHL administrator/moderator.

For everything else such as documentation and/or making your own Half-Life modification, please use the [upstream](https://github.com/twhl-community/halflife-updated) repository instead.
